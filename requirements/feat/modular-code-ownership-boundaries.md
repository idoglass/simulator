# FR-GR-038

- Source GR ID: GR-038
- Priority: P1
- Status: Implemented

## Feature Requirement
Keep code modular with clear ownership boundaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Modules and interfaces are documented, and cross-module dependencies remain controlled.

## Implementation
- docs/MODULAR_BOUNDARIES.md documents ownership (domain, workflows, adapters, config) and references architecture_boundary_check.py.

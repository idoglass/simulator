# FR-GR-030

- Source GR ID: GR-030
- Priority: P0
- Status: Draft

## Feature Requirement
Support request/message matching rules and verification assertions for expected interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Simulator supports configurable match rules (for example message type, header/field values, and sequence context).
- Simulator can assert expected interactions occurred (count/order/content) during or after a run.
- Verification results are exposed in both GUI and TUI with pass/fail status and mismatch details.
